Forge 1.18 Custom Base Client.
Hello! no im not back this is more of a when im bored thing. 
wanted to code so i decided i would make my own custom base client supporting newest versions of mc.
This client is 100% custom base and its going to stay that way not going to be another cousinware where its 75% skid.
Also i can tell its missing many things like a gui, settings and much more ill be adding those when i push a new update to the repo. Just wanted to make this public because it doesnt benifit me
